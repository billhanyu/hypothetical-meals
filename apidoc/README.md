# API Doc For Brian

Hi Brian, this is the API doc for the backend, we'll keep updating.

If this is your first time using gitbook, you can look at how to use it [here](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/setup.html).

You might need to do `gitbook install`.

I guess you might need to pay attention to if the request object is an array or object. We have not been consistent on that.
